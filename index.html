        <div class="content">
            <p>Following the publication of "A Life Cut Short: The Story of Manuel 'Jun' Reguero Jr.," journalist Mia Dela Cruz’s article about Jun’s life and tragic death, Jun’s cousin, Jay Reguero, agreed to sit down for an interview. The following is a transcript of that conversation.</p>

            <p><b>Interviewer:</b> Thank you for speaking with me, Jay. I know this isn’t easy.</p>

<p><b>Jay:</b> Yeah. Um, thanks for having me.</p>

<p><b>Interviewer:</b> After Mia Dela Cruz’s article was published, there’s been a lot of discussion about Jun’s story. How do you feel about the reaction?</p>

<p><b>Jay:</b> I don’t know. It’s kinda weird, I guess, but my cousin Grace and I agreed to tell his story, and, uh yeah. He wanted to help people. I think he’d be happy that people are listening.</p>

<p><b>Interviewer:</b> Mia is a friend of yours, right? Do you think she captured Jun’s story the way you wanted?</p>

<p><b>Jay:</b> Yeah, she knew how much he meant to me. I trusted her to do her best.</p>

<p><b>Interviewer:</b> In her article, Mia mentioned that Jun was frustrated with the government and the church, but also with his own family. That includes your uncle, Police Chief Reguero.
</p>

<p>(Jay is quiet for a moment.)</p>

<p><b>Jay:</b> It’s... a tough time for the family, my uncle, um, I think he’s grieving in his own way.</p>

<p><b>Interviewer:</b> Your uncle kicked Jun out of the house after finding out he was using drugs. Do you think that decision led to what happened next?</p>

<p><b>Jay:</b> I don’t know. I can’t say…It’s complicated. I just know that Jun deserved better.</p>

<p><b>Interviewer:</b> How did you react when you found out that Jun was not the person you thought he was?</p>

<p><b>Jay:</b> It was...It was very hard to hear, the truth being thrown to your face like a big anvil. Um, me and Grace just felt like Jun's image had been shattered, but he was human like any of us. He had struggles and he fought as hard as he could. We talked about it, how Jun's legacy shouldn't be replaced with all that bad you know, we chose to remember his compassion and share his story.</p> 

<p><b>Interviewer:</b> I agree with that, your cousin was a good person, choosing drugs shouldn't drag down his legacy.</p>

<p><b>Jay:</b> Yeah, that's how I would put it.</p>

<p><b>Interviewer:</b> I heard you and your cousin Grace plan to continue fighting against the injustices. Do you think Jun would want you to do so?</p>

<p><b>Jay:</b> Yeah. I think he would. He never wanted to just sit back and watch people suffer. He wanted to do something. And, uh, I guess... I don’t want everything he did to just—just disappear, you know?</p>

<p><b>Interviewer:</b> What does continuing his fight look like for you?</p>

<p><b>Jay:</b> I don’t know yet. I’m not like Jun. I don’t have his, um, his confidence or his way with words. But I think just telling his story is a start. People should know what’s happening. Not just to him, but to so many others.</p>

<p><b>Interviewer:</b> Do you think the government will listen?</p>

<p><b>Jay:</b> I don’t know. But I have to try. We have to try.</p>

<p><b>Interviewer:</b> Many Filipinos would disagree. Most believe that the government is too corrupt for change. What do you say about that?</p>

</p><b>Jay:</b> (laughs softly) Yeah… a lot of adults around me say that. And sometimes it just—it just brings me down. But then I remember Jun’s words. He always said people should make a stand for what they believe in, even if it feels impossible. I promise I’ll never give up.</p>

</p><b>Interviewer:</b> But some might say this is dangerous. Especially for a seventeen-year-old. Are you ready to die for what you believe in?</p>

<p><b>Jay:</b> (pauses, shifts uncomfortably) I think—I think I already know the answer to that. You’re not the first person to ask me. And my answer is, um… yes. I am. It’s not that I want to die or anything. I just, I feel closer to my country, to my family, when I fight for this.

<p><b>Interviewer:</b> That’s a big weight to carry. Do your parents support your decision?</p>

<p><b>Jay:</b> They’re worried. My mom, especially. She doesn’t want me to get involved, but she also knows I’m not just gonna stop.</p>

<p><b>Interviewer:</b> If Jun were here now, what do you think he’d say to you?</p>

<p><b>Jay:</b> (smiles a little) He’d probably call me an idiot for putting myself in danger. But he’d also—he’d also tell me he’s proud.
Interviewer: And are you proud of him?</p>

<p><b>Jay:</b> Yes. Always.</p>

<p><b>Interviewer:</b> Thank you for your time, Jay.</p>

<p><b>Jay:</b> Yeah, thanks.</p>

<p>Jay may not have all the answers, but one thing is clear—he's not giving up.</p>
